### 1.0 What is python virtual environment?

Python virtual environments create isolated contexts to keep dependencies required by different projects separate so they don't interfere with other projects or system-wide packages.

### 1.1 Create python virtual environment with venv

```bash
# at root folder
python -m venv .data_exploration

# this will create a python virtual environment named "data_exploration"

# activate the virtual environment
source .data_exploration/bin/activate
```

### 1.2 Activate the virtual environment and install dependencies

With your virtual environment activated, type this command to install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).
> What is poetry? 
: Poetry is a widely used tool for dependency management and packaging in Python


```bash
pip install poetry

# install all the packages and dependencies
poetry install 
```

Other useful poetry commands
```bash
# add dependencies
poetry add <library_name>

# when it takes long time to revolve dependencies
poetry cache clear --all pypi

# add dev dependencies
poetry add <library_name> --group dev

# remove dependencies
poetry remove <library_name>

# run pytest
poetry run pytest
```

If you want to deactivate the virtual environment, simply type

```bash
deactivate
```
